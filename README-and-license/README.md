Want to deploy an old practice project in git pages

When I tried this method before, it automatically made the README the root file and therefore did not deploy correctly in GitPages. With this project, I have added the README at the end with the hope that it will set the html file as the root and deploy correctly.

Deleting the README to re-add later did not work and gave me a 404 error upon re-deployment.

I deleted the README again and then created a folder to put it into hoping it will no longer be the root file
